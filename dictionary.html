          This dictionary is an evolving body of work; even though our language
          has been dormant for many decades, there are a handful of researchers
          and archivists who have and continue to document and analyze it. We
          cross-reference and verify dictionary entries utilizing many bodies of
          work as cited in the sections below:

              George Izard was a senior Army officer and the second governor of
              the Arkansas Territory from 1825 to 1828. He took an interest in
              Native languages during his tenure as governor and compiled a
              Quapaw vocabulary containing 226 entries. These entries are
              reliable, with very few noted exceptions.

              <summary>Lewis F. Hadley (1882)</summary>
              Lewis F. Hadley was a linguist and missionary who lived in Indian
              Territory (what is now Arkansas) during the late 1800s. His work
              is extremely unreliable. Most aspects of Hadley’s system of
              spelling fail to accurately represent the pronunciation of Quapaw.
              There is no consistency with vowels and consonants, in addition to
              a lack of understanding of the basic Dhegiha language concepts and
              sounds. Hadley's work is referred to minimally in our language
              work.

              </figure>
              James Owen Dorsey was an ethnologist and linguist who spent most
              of his professional life documenting the language and culture of
              the Dhegiha tribes: Quapaw, Omaha, Ponca, Osage, and Kanza
              <i>(Kaw)</i> Tribes. Dorsey’s primary focus was the Omaha.
              Dorsey’s Quapaw work consists of folklore, mythology, history,
              texts, linguistic notes, vocabulary, personal names, and names for
              other tribes.

              Dr. Robert L. Rankin was a linguist and lecturer at the University
              of Kansas. He spent most of his life studying and documenting
              Siouan languages. In 1973, he came to Oklahoma to visit the Quapaw
              and work with the few remaining speakers. This field work,
              combined with the previously-noted historic documentation, allowed
              Rankin to compile the most complete and accurate body of written
              works regarding Okáxpa. He worked on his Quapaw dictionary
              (compiled from his own field work and from the work of the
              aforementioned researchers) until his death in 2014.

          In addition to written sources, our dictionary is largely compiled
          from numerous recorded interviews with the following Okáxpa speakers:

        <p>
          When tackling a continuity error or similar problem in our language
          work, we often cross-reference our own information with Quapaw's
          neighbors in the Dhegiha language family:
          <em>Osage, Omaha, Kanza <i>(Kaw)</i>, and Ponca.</em> Our five tribes
          were once a united people, so our languages share many similarities.
          The Dhegiha sources our department utilizes most frequently are as
          follows:
