The outer ring of the seal is split in half vertically and consists of two blocks of color; the left side is dark blue and the right side is red. These two colors are separated by a thick, golden yellow line. The word 'O-GAH-PAH' is contained within this outer ring in a blocky, white, sans-serif font with a black outline. The inner ring of the seal is outlined in white and has four black-and-white eagle feathers hanging down from the ring's outer circumference; the feathers are equidistant from one another. Within the inner circle of the seal, there is a sketch of a brown bison standing on green grass against a cloud-filled sky blue background."
