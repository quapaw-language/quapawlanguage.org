      <!-- Purpose -->
      <section>
        <h2 id="purpose">Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The Quapaw Nation Language Department began work on this website in
          the fall of 2024, shortly after the initial formation of our
          department. Our goal is to provide our tribal nation with a
          comprehensive online reference for learning the Quapaw language. While
          this site is still a work-in-progress, we are pleased with its layout
          and simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prominent features of this site include the
          <i>Okáxpa</i> searchable <a href="/dictionary.html">dictionary</a>,
          our database of
          <a href="/curriculum.html">language-learning materials</a>, as well as
          a <a href="/blog.html">blog</a> where we post departmental updates and
          write-ups. Additionally, we maintain a
          <a href="/docs.html">historical archive</a> of written works related
          to our language which spans from the early 1800s to present times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, Quapaw is considered a <i>dormant language</i>, which
          means there are no living fluent speakers. Luckily, we have access to
          archived historical and academic works which document the meaning,
          structure, and stories of our language. Simply put, this site serves
          as vessel for our people and the way our ancestors communicated in the
          times before colonization and forced assimilation stripped us of our
          culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal as a department, and thus as an extension of our tribal
          nation and government, is to revitalize our language so that future
          generations will speak <i>Okáxpa</i>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="dhegiha">Dhegiha Language Resources</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Okáxpa</em> is a Siouan language which shares strong similarity
          with a number of other indigenous languages:
          <em>Ponca, Omaha, Osage, and Kanza.</em>
          This is because, long ago, our tribes existed as
          <a href="https://youtu.be/fHBfGsicKNw?si=dfk3zIf0QhrvuQFq"
            >one unified people</a
          >. Following a journey along the Mississippi River and a subsequent
          westward migration, our people separated geographically and developed
          into these five modern tribes. Modern academics classify this original
          group as the <mark>Dhegiha subgroup,</mark> a term which our tribal
          nations have since co-opted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of our tribes maintains our own language, but we convene as one
          each year at the Dhegiha Language Confernce to discuss new ways to
          perpetuate and teach our languages. Our tribes have strong ties to one
          another; we cherish our history both as one and as separate nations.
          Below, you will find links to our sister tribes' online language-based
          resources. We encourage you to visit each one to begin to understand
          the differences and similarities between our languages:

          Our department extends our deepest thanks to
          <b>Dr. Robert Rankin</b> for his lifelong study and thorough
          documentation of Dhegiha languages, without whom our work would be an
          uphill battle. Additionally, we thank
          <b>Billy Supernaw Proctor</b> for his decades-long dedication to
          studying, deconstructing, and teaching <i>Okáxpa</i>. Finally, we give
          utmost praise to those persons who interviewed and recorded our last
          fluent speakers. We owe you and your kin a great debt and hope you
          will be proud of our work.
