        <h2>Valentine's Day in Ok√°xpa</h2>
        <p>
          <mark class="date"> Posted February 3rd, 2025 </mark>
        </p>
        <p>
          Mary Jacobs, our department's director, illustrated a handful of Valentine's
          Day memes to share with friends and family. Although Valentine's Day
          originates from Anglican Europe and has no history within our tribe,
          our tribal members often celebrate American holidays such as these.
          There are four memes: each one contains a word or phrase in Quapaw and
          an equivalent English translation. We have included details of our
          translations in the captions below each image. Feel free to save these
          memes and share them with your loved ones this Valentine's season! üíï

            alt="This image epicts a hand-drawn illustration of two Native Americans in traditional Plains attire. The man has his arm around the woman and they have hearts drawn on their clothes. They stand against a background of pale red hearts. The Quapaw phrase, 'ƒÑko≈æa tte√°' is written above the couple, and the English translation, 'let's dance' sits below the phrase."
          />
          <figcaption>
            <b>ƒÑko≈æa tte√°</b> is a commanding phrase which means, "let's (you
            and I) dance."
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          <b>ƒÑko≈æa tte√°</b> is a great phrase to say to your crush at the
          Pow-Wow when you just <i>have</i> to dance with them. In our
          traditions, the woman in the couple would ask the man to dance, but we
          don't discriminate here. Use this phrase to tell your partner, no
          matter who they are, that they have no choice but to get out there and
          two step with you. Remember, <b>ƒÖko≈æa tte√°</b> is not a question or
          invitation to dance, you're <em>commanding</em> them to dance with
          you! üëØ

          <img
            src="/img/blog/2025/vday_meme_kiss.png"
            alt="This image depicts a hand-drawn illustration of puckered, cartoonish red lips against a background of pale red hearts. The Quapaw words, '√≠ha kikd√©' sit above the lips in a scrawly font with the English word, 'kiss' below them. "
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          The phrase <b>√≠ha kikd√©</b> means, "to kiss." The noun
          <b>√≠ha</b> represents the mouth, while the verb <b>kikd√©</b> indicates
          a joining with the subject of the phrase. Literally, this translates
          as, <em>"joining mouths together."</em> Not quite as catchy as
          <em>"kiss,"</em> so we used the most memorable English translation in
          the meme.

            alt="This image depicts a hand-drawn illustration of Cupid, but with the physical features of a Native American with dark-toned skin, moccasins, and long black braids. He is drawing an arrow back from his bow and flies against a sky background. The Quapaw phrase, '≈æokd√© wak√≠de' is spelled above his head, accompanied by its English translation, 'couple connector.'"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <b>≈Ωokd√© Wak√≠de</b> roughly translates as the "Couple Connector" and
            serves as a Quapaw take on the idea of Cupid.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          <b>≈Ωokd√© Wak√≠de</b> is an interesting phrase which represents the idea
          of Cupid in Ok√°xpa. We Quapaws have no mythical figure in our oral
          tradition that serves a similar function as the trickster matchmaker,
          so our department decided to run with a simple description of someone
          who causes others to go out with one another. The full phrase
          literally means,
          <em>"one who causes them to be together."</em> Creating this phrase
          was a process which we completed together as a department.
        </p>
        <p>
          We started with the word <b>≈æokd√©</b>. This verb literally translates
          as, <em>"to be with someone,"</em> or <em>"to be together."</em> We
          wanted to then convey that there was a person who caused the people
          <em>(couple)</em> to be together with one another, so we constructed
          the phrase <b>wak√≠de</b> to go with it. The root causative of the
          phrase, <b>-k√≠de</b>, is a verb which means,
          <em>"to cause one's own"</em> and must be combined with a prefix to
          have complete meaning. The prefix in question, <b>wa-</b>, has many
          different meanings. However, the main function of <b>wa-</b> is to
          indicate a plural number of objects, and in this case it simply
          performs in English equivalency as, <em>"them."</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          So all together, <b>≈Ωokd√© Wak√≠de</b> literally means,
          <em>"one who causes them (those people) to be with one another."</em>
          Obviously this phrase isn't quite as catchy in English as it is in our
          <i>Ok√°xpa i√©</i>, so we came up with the alliterative translation,
          "Couple Connector," to serve as a more memorable translation for those
          who see this short-form meme.

            src="/img/blog/2025/vday_meme_candy.png"
            alt="This image depicts a hand-drawn illustration of a Native American wearing a headdress and feather, holding out a handful of Valentine's heart-shaped candy, against a pink-and-white spiral background. The word, 'wask√≠de' appears below the drawing of the boy. The English translated word, 'candy' appears below the caption."
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          <b>Wask√≠de</b> is a noun which colloquially translates as "sweets" in
          English. However, <b>wask√≠de</b> can indicate any kind of sweet treat,
          like fruits or candy.
