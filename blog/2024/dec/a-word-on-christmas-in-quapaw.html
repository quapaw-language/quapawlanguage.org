              The Quapaw people did not hold a concept of Christmas until
              colonization, but they did adopt a named gift-giving tradition
              sometime in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.

        <p>
          Christmas is a difficult concept to translate into the Quapaw language
          <em>(Okáxpa íe).</em> This is because our people did not observe or
          hold a concept of Christmas until after colonization and the
          subsequent purveyance of Catholic traditions. The word itself
          originates from the joining of the Old English equivalents of
          “Christ,” and “mass,” neither of which translate directly into the
          <em>Okáxpa íe</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In post-colonial times, the word <em><b>owíbn&aogon;</b></em> was used to
          indicate a gift-giving tradition roughly dated to the early 20th
          century. Quapaw elder Maude Supernaw describes this practice during a
          taped audio interview from the 1960s. In the interview, she says that
          the gifts were given at a special time when Quapaw would visit each
          other’s homes to sing, similar to the concept of caroling. Thus,
          <em>owíbną</em> was said when imparting gifts to these visitors.
          However, it is unclear what time of year this tradition occurred; it
          may have been near the time of the Winter Solstice but sources are not
          conclusive.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the 1980s, some Quapaw families began to use <em>owíbną</em> to
          mean, “Merry Christmas.” In an interview with elder Odestine McWatters
          dated from the mid-1990s, she uses the word to mean, “Christmas.” This
          is the way some families interpreted the phrase over time, although it
          should not be taken as a literal translation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way to say “Merry Christmas” in Okáxpa is,
          <strong>wakǫ́ta ižįke íttade</strong>. This phrase translates literally
          as, <em>“God’s Son is Born.”</em> This is how other
          <a href="/about.html#dhegiha">Dhegiha tribes</a> say the phrase, as
          well. It is more accurate and faithful to the structure of our
          language to use this term;
          <b>we encourage its usage in publication.</b> Even so, our department
          recognizes the significance of the <em>"owíbną"</em> phrase to many Quapaw families
          in our modern times.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter how you choose to celebrate the holiday season, we invite
          you to integrate the <em>Okáxpa íe</em> into your well-wishing
          traditions.
